san francisco call.,['San Francisco'],1903-09-09,"themselves to realize that the men who
flocked to California in '49 and subse
quently were the ones who did real yeo
man work in laying the foundations of the
great commonwealth and that it would be
the later Influx of settlers who would far
outshadow the few who had come before
in the light of subsequent history.
After much opposition, the early settlers
at last gave way and in July, 1853, the
constitution was so amended that all
those who had come to California prior to
January 1, 1S50, could be admitted Into the
society. But the distinction yet remained
that the early settlers, or those who had
come to the West before '49, should con
stitute a class, with class privileges. As
a result of the removal of the barrier
against the men of '49 the membership of
the society was doubled before the end of
the year.
Daring Vigilantes Led by
William T. Coleman
Against Crime.
THE part played by the Pioneers in
the social life of the fifties cannot
be overestimated. In those days of
restless money getting, when San
Francisco was, at its best, a very
poor place in which to live,
when gamblers and murderers elbowed
respectable citizens into the gutters, and
crime in all its hideous shapes, was rife,
the fraternal spirit of the society acted as
a counter-irritant to the demoralizing in
fluences of the time. To the man, wearied
by the hurry and confusion of early San
Francisco life and sick for the noble com
radeship of a good man the society of
fered the safest refuge. . While gambling
dens and dance balls were nightly offer
ing their tawdry attractions to the young
man, wearied by the day's tail, the rooms
of the society were the only 'safe haven.
L. Folsom; assistant recording secretary,
J. C. L. Wadsworth; corresponding sec
retary, Edwin Bryant. To realize the
part which these men played in the early
history of California we have only to re
flect that the names of four of them have
been perpetuated by being applied to four
of the streets of San Francisco. Bry
ant afterward became the author of one
of the earliest books on California life,
entitled ""What I Saw In California.""
From its very inception the society
came to command the respect and honor
of all. In the monster procession which
was held to celebrate the news of the re
ception of California into the Union, Colo
nel Stevenson, the grand marshal, placed
the Pioneers In the fore-front of the line.
Again, at the occasion of its first public
celebration, the society marched through
the streets and afterward kept open
house, entertaining State and city digni
taries with a lavish hand. Well could the
society claim for itself pre-eminence at
that time. Among 1 the first members_were
the following noted men in subsequent his
tory: General Henry W. Halleck, Gen
eral William T. Sherman, General John C.
Fremont, General John W. Geary, General
George A. Stoneman, General Henry M.
Naglee, General Joseph Hooker, Commo
dore Robert F. Stockton,* Commodore Sel
fridge—all men who either had become
famous or were destined to achieve great
mark in the Civil War.
As the society grew older, it began to
become evident that if its membership
were confined strictly to the men who
came to California before 1849 it would
soon cease altogether, so the movement
to Incorporate members who were in the
land of gold before California was admit
ted to the Union began to be agitated.
Strange to us of the present day appears
the jealousy which was maintained by the
first settlers against the argonauts. In
their narrowness they could not bring

*«""^UT for the first Inspiration of the
A^ Bociety we must look farther back
J*J than the days of gold; we
must consider the very first pio
neers who drifted down upon Cal
ifornia when it was yet a dreamy
pravlnce of old Mexico. Before '43 there
were stirring events which tended to weld
the first American settlers Into a compact
body with a common cause and common
needs. In the days of the Bear Flag revo
lu'.ion at Sonoma, which are touched upon
in another part of this paper, and in the
fierce heat of the ensuing conquest of
California by General John C. Fremont
and .ommodore R- F. Stockton, the men
banded together in support of their new
homes and their mother country far over
the mountains sowed the seed from which
was to cpring the great society. To the
very earliest blood of the society, organ
lz< i by these earliest settlers, there was
infused the new stock of the argonauts.
From these two branches sprang the or
pnnization which was to do so much in
support of the patriotic sentiments of
the later generation— the native children
of California.
Among those who were the very earliest
Fettlers in the territory of California were
two who did much to inaugurate the so
ciety, Samuel Brannan and Colonel Jona
than D. Stevenson. Brannan had come
around the Horn in 1846 with the Mormon
colony which had Intended to find In Cali
fornia an abiding place for the Saints, so
recently driven out of their city of Nau
voo. Illinois. The Mormons found that
the settlers from the East had already
pre-empted the country, but they made
the best of It and stayed in the new ter-
Thus, with their work wel' established,
the Pioneers who yet remain look back
upon that which has been of their doing
and justly feel that they have tried to
perform their full measure of private
duty and oubllc benefaction, and leave
a fair measure of good to the new Cali
fornia whose growth has been so greatly
stimulated by. their effort*,
and have to call upon the assistance of
their brothers. As an example of what
Is done by the relief fund the figures of
disbursements for'the last two years
may be cited.
The total disbursements for relief In
1901-02 were $10,234. equal to an average
payment of JS55. For 1902-03 th» total
relief offered amounted to $11,320 90, mak
ing an average monthly payment of 1344.
Forty-seven worthy beneficiaries claimed
assistance in 1901-02, and In the succeed
ing year the number was forty.
The finances of the Pioneers, thanks
to the generosity of James Lick and the
perfect management of the funds since
the time of the society's lnceotlon. are
In such a condition as to warrant the gen
erous assistance given members in dis
tress. As the result of wisely invested In
terests, the assets of the society were
valued at $335,843 06 at the last report of
the treasurer. With such a firm founda
tion, the organization Is In a position to
rival many benevolent and fraternal so
cieties with far greater membership.

Commodore Stockton's proclamation
upon the raising of the Stars
and Stripes over California soil
is also among the relics treas
ured by the Pioneers. There are
clippings from old newspapers announc
ing the sailing of steamers to the land of
gold, faded pictures of familiar scenes in
the early history of the city, the bell of
the Monumental Fire Company, which,
used to sound the alarms of the Vigi
lantes, and even the battered plug hat
and rusty sword of ""Norton, Emperor by
the grace of God."" A visit to Pioneer
Hall Is in itself a full course in the his
tory of our State.
completion of the new structure, the so
ciety entered Into its new home with one
of the most brilliant social functions of
the year. The first important step which
was made after the new building had
been put into use was the creation of a
relief fund. Already some of the earlier
members were becoming infirm with age
and many were broken in fortune. With
the generous gift of 1500, made by Rob
ert J. Tiffany, the relief fund soon grew
to the $10,000 mark and since that time
has been kept at that sum, notwithstand
ing the many deeds of charity which have
been done by the society for the benefit
of needy members.
On October 3. 1S73. Lick made another
generous gift to the society of which ; he
was an enthusiastic rr-ember. This was
a deed to the magnificent site where Pio
neer Hall now stands on the corner of
Fourth and Stevenson streets. Lick had
desired that his name and the fame of
the organization should be perpetuated
by a building which should be a lasting
monument to both. In September,
1S73, Lick made the Pioneers one of his
residuary legatees In the deed of trust
through which the final disposition of his
great estate was to be made. By these
two benefices that capitalist and philan
thropist put the Society of California
Pioneers in the position of being one of
the richest social organizations of the
State.
Housed in Magnificent
Quarters, Destiny Is
Fulfilled.
Y ICK died on September 30, 1876.
/ and great trouble was destined to
J-^ surround the munificent gift which
he had made before the society could
derive any benefit therefrom. When
In 18S2 the society had not yet
received Its benefice from the ""Lick
Trust,"", which was closing up the es
tate, a committee was appointed to in
vestigate the affairs of the executors and
report to the society. This committee
made some sensational charges against
the executors of the estate and a remark
able degree of excitement was aroused
both in the society and by the public
press. * But it was fairly shown to the
society that all the time that the Lick
benefice was tied up in the estate It was
gathering larger and larger accretions of
wealth. When the"" estate was finally set
tled in 1S0C, the cash benefit to the so
ciety amounted to JG04.65J OS.
Before the Lick estate had been di
vided, the agitation for a . new Pioneer
Hall, to be erected on the lot which Lick
had presented to the society in 1873. was
commenced. After considerable opposi
tion, a permanent building committee was
selected and after first relncorporatlng
under, the new constitution, work upon
the present structure, was commenced.
The cornerstone was laid on September
7, 1S84. and in due season the society en
tered into its^ permanent home. Since
that time the old Pioneers have been loy
ally standing shoulder to shoulder, clos
ing the gaps as they are made by the
hand of the reaper and resolutely foster
ing the same old spirit which obtained
when first the young Pioneers marched
at the head of the procession on the first
Admission Day celebration.
The purposes for which the Society of
California> Pioneers was formed and is
maintained are thus succinctly stated In
its constitution:
""The society is designed to be a moral,
should take a number and thus sink his
personality for the sake of the secrecy
necessary to successfully carry on the
work which had to be done. >
Immediately the question arose: ""Who
shall be number one?"" At once Coleman
-was singled out by his associates. Cole
man vainly tried to refuse, but at last
was forced to acquiesce. Thus was the
strength of the Pioneers represented in
""No. 1"" of the famous Vigilance Com
mittee of ""56.
At this time a man was elevated to the
presidency of the society whose name is
Inseparable from the early history of
California. This was Thomas O. Larkln.
He had come to Monterey in 1S32, being
therefore one of the very first Americans
to settle in California. As consular agent
of the United States during the time when
our Government was making manifest
plans to lay hold of the western coast, he
did much. He was a worthy representa
tive of the old order of things among the
pioneers.
During Larkin's presidency the entire
board of directors was made up of forty,
niners, he being the sole representative of
the old conservative first settlers. From
this time forward, the younger branch of
the society remained in control almost to
the total exclusion of the old guard.
The first headquarters of the society
were In the old Bella Union building, on
Washington street, near Kearny. This
was then the center of the business dis
trict of the city, and the building in
which the Pioneers lodged was considered
a remarkably fine one. In 1860, however,
James Lick made his first gift to the so
ciety in the form of a lot on Montgomery
street, near Pacific, where now can be
still seen a dingy old hall, at present the
headquarters of a livery stable, with the
legend, Pioneers, across its stone front.
As a result of one of San Francisco's
great .fires, , which ruined hundreds and
paralyzed business temporarily, the So
ciety of -California Pioneers languished
during the early '60's. But through the
earnest endeavors of O. P. Sutton, Wll
lard B. Farwell and William R. Wheaton,
interest was revived in 1S62. By the plan
of having numerous individuals take out
life memberships, a fund of $3000 toward
the erection of the building upon the lot
donated by Lick was accumulated.

rllE society was then forced to de
vise means for placing a mortgage
on its property in order that
more building funds could be raised.
No sufficient authority for such ac
tion being vested in the officers,
it became necessary to have an act
passed by the Legislature bestowing upon
the president, ' secretary and board of di
rectors the necessary authority for such
a step. Wlllard B. Farwell, who was at
this time one of those most active in com
pleting the reorganization of the society,
' secured the passage of the act, and the
mortgage was given. To provide against
possible contingencies of a like nature,
the society drew up articles of Incorpora
tion and on January 28, 1S63, they were
filed and the organization thus started on
a firm legal basis. •"". - rt •
With all obstructions thus removed, the

It was at this meeting at an Iron ware
house on Montgomery street then, that
the California Society of Pioneers was or
ganized. On September 27, when the con
stitution and by-laws had been drawn up,
the announcement of the existence of the
rocie-ty was made in the morning papers.
The Herald commented upon the an
nouncement in the following editorial:
""We have seen no movement In our
midst so fraught with interest as the
formation of the California Society of
Pioneers. Most of our readers are proba
bly unaware that the old settlers have
united In a society with the view of prc
feiving a record of the various historical
incidents connected with the early colon
ization of California by Americans, which

brought about through this organization.

rltory. Brannan started the first paper,
Uie ""California Star."" and through Its
columns did much to bring California be
fore the eyes of the Eastern states. His
friend and co-worker. Colonel Stevenson,
had come across the continent with the
famous Stevenson regiment just at the
close of the Mexican War and had set
tled at San Francisco, there to become
later a prominent figure in the early his
tory of the State.
The steamship California, which ar
rived at San Francisco on August 23. 1850,
brought news of the death of President
Taylor. By W. D. M. Howard, J. C. I*
Wadpworth and Brannan it was proposed
to call together all of the ""old residents""
of the vicinity to pay due respect to hia
memory. This call did not include any
of the argonauts who had come in '49, for
the earlier pioneers were very jealous of
their distinction as such and looked upon
the men of the gold rush, if not In th*
light of intruders, certainly not worthy
of the titles of pioneers. Accordingly the
following notice appeared in Brannan's
paper of August 30:
""The early pioneers of California are-
requested to call at the Iron Warehouse of
Howard & Mellus, on Montgomery street,

When In the fevered days of the gold
rush, men poured into California through
every mountain pass end on every in
coming vessel, there was born In them
a generous spirit of fellowship and rough
fraternal affection. The perils of the
plains ar.d of the snowy Sierras, the many
hardships of the mining camps where
often men were forced to band themselves
together for protection against lawless
ness, the open handed generosity of those
fortunate ones who found themselves sud
denly made rich— all these influences in
evitably drew men into a closer bond of
fellowship. A mutual pride of the State
was felt among them; a mutual desire
to build well the foundations for the
great future impelled them; a mutual
respect for one another united them.
Forty-three years ago to-day these sim
ple yet sublimely touching words were
uttered by on* of the strong: men of the

i THE SAN FKANCJSCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, ~1903.
It was at this period in the .history
of the Pioneers that the sterling
worth of the members of the society
was demonstrated in an hour of nead.
When San Francisco was overrun with
murderers. and blacklegs and justice was
blinded by the machinations of desperate
and unprincipled politicians, the Vigilance
Committee sprang into existence. At its
head was William T. Coleman, a leader
among the Pioneers. Among its members
were numbered over a hundred Pioneers
who enrolled themselves gladly to serve
the city in its hour of need.
In 1851 when the Vigilantes were first
organized, Coleman became a member of
the executive committee. When ' James
Stuart, arrested for the assault committed
upon an innocent' storekeeper, was tried
by the Vigilantes, Coleman acted as pros
ecuting attorney. When the organization
arrested John Jenkins, known as ""Sydney
Cove,"" Samuel Brannan and Coleman
were those most active> in securing for
the prisoner ' fair but speedy justice and
they had their hands on the rope which
swung the guilty man into eternity.
It was at the organization of the second
Vigilance Committee of 1856 that Coleman
and Brannan, together with Major John
W. Geary, all members of the Pioneer So
ciety, figured prominently. The incidents
of the first steps j toward . armed ! protec
tion showed that Coleman and bis asso
ciates were tried men and true. . .
When James King of William was shot
down in cold blood by James P.. Casey,
excitement raged to a fever heat and it
was Coleman' s steady hand which crystal
lized indignant protest into armed resist
ance,to rampant. lawlessness. The morn
ing after the murder the. members of the
old committee met at a hall on Sacra
mento, street near Leldesdorfr. Coleman
took the lead by penning a strong oath of
fealty to the cause to which they were
pledged. He suggested . that . each man

BOOM HERE, IT IS PREDICTED,
WILL ECLIPSE 1848 GOLD RUSH
CHICAGO, Dee. 4. —California's sur
passing advantages as a good place
ama canal is about to open Ibe world’s
markets to the state’s products—-were
proclaimed all day long recently at
the land show. The day was Cali -
fornia’s at the Coliseum, and orators
and exhibitors put forth special ef
fort to impress on the thousands who
Hocked into the vast structure thai
the slate is about to enter an era of
prosperity compared with which the
boom that followed the gold rush will
fade into insignificance.
In the addresses in various halls
special emphasis was laid on the Pan
ama-California exposition in 1915. .1.
A. Jasper of San Diego was the chief
lecturer on this topic, hut all the oth
er speakers dwelt on it. Other speak
ers were D. \V. McDaniels, who talked
about the general resources of (In
state, and Miss Hose Shelton, whose
special topic was the winter resorls.
All the lectures were illustrated with
vivid moving pictures, California,
among other blessings, enjoying a rep
utation of being the best place On
earth to take moving pictures. The
climate and the atmosphere, especially
in the south, are particularly conducive
to good photography. The pictures
that proved most attractive were those
of the (’.awston ostrich farm and the
rose carnival at Pasadena.
California’s exhibit covers more
space than any at the show. That of
the southern part of the stale, the
region below the Teliachapi river, is
the most extensive. It includes t i
booths and the cost to bring il to
Chicago and set it op reached approx
imately SIO,OOO.
Charles C. Wilson is in charge. He
is a member of the Chamber of Com
merce of Los Angeles and is the gen
eral manager of the Southern Califor
nia-Panama exposition coinmissidn.
This commission is paying the hills
of the Southern California display. For
merly this work was undertaken by
the Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce. hut when the commission,
which embraces all the Southern Cali
fornia counties, was formed ti • look
after that section’s part in the 1915
show if also took over this general
publicity work.
In the variety of its products Hie
California exhibit surpasses anything
in the t.oliseum. The state grows
practically everything raised anywhere
else in the country.
The fruit, exhibit proves mosf at
tractive to the casual visitor. il
ranges through citrus fruits peculiar
to that section to deciduous fruits
grown in profusion elsewhere. There
are pears, plums, apricots, peaches,
qirnces, oranges, lemons, pomegran
ates, alligator pears, mangoes and many
others. There is a good display of
nuts, olives and olive oil. Even cot
lon is getting to he a typical Cali
fornia product. They are raising much
of good quality in the Imperial val
ley.
*»rio of the little things in the South
ern California display that attracted
the interest of the women especially
were the “eucalyptus curtains.” They
are made of the seed pods of the euca
lyptus tree.

HOME MADE OLIVE OIL
Written for the California Cultivator
by L. .1. Phelps: I beg to submit for;
the benefit of your readers a method'
of making a small amount of olive oil j
for family use. 1 have followed Hum
plan for a number of years with per- j
feel success.
When picking Hie olives for pickling
I leave all the small ones on the trees.;
Some time in the next month or two;
when 1 have leisure 1 go through the
grove again and pick as many of the
small ones as I wish for oil. I gel
one gallon id' oil from about SO pounds
of olives. I spread .the fruit out in
drying trays so that they stand not
more than one inch deep and stack
the trays in Hie shed with strips be
tween or stack crossways to allow
ventilation. They remain thus til!
some time during the winter, when
Hu- berries have become somewhat
shriveled. This part is not necessary,
hut they work better when about one
quarter dry.
Some day in January or February
when il rains too hard lo work out
side 1 make my oil. As the weather
is ususaliy cool enough to congeal the
oil it is necessary to provide some
artificial heat. 1 first put a quantity
of the berries in a tub of warm wa
ter. about. 100 degrees, then grind
them through my cider mill into a tub.
I have prepared some squares of bur
lap about twice the size of (lie crib
of my press and pack the crushed
olives in the crib in layers with the
burlap after the lime honored meth
od of building a cheese in a cider
press, except that I use no wooden
slats between the layers.
For a settling lank 1 take a 10-gal
lon olive cask, knock out Hit- bead,
here a half-inch hole in the side near
the hoHoni tor a spigot and stand a
piece nf inch gas pipe in il just
long enough lo reach above the side,
Inin ihi-s tank I put the juice as
il comes from the press. When the
cheese is as dry as I can get il I
take il from the press, strip the lay
ers of pomace from the burlap, throw
them iiitn a tub and heat them up
with warm water, not hot, and press
them the seciunt time, after which 1
throw the pomace away.
1 usually let the second cheese stand
in Ho- press until me next day. forc
ing down the screw from time to lime.
If my settling tank is not full when
I have finished all my olives, I nearly
fill il with warm water to facilitate
skimming off the oil. pouring Hie wa
ter from the spout of a teakettle
through the gas pipe so that the wil
ier enters Hie bottom without disturb
ing the oil on the surface.
The juice should he allowed to slam!
in the settling tank Iwn or three weeks,
occasionally drawing off a few quarts
of the liquid from the spigot and re
placing it with warm water through
the pipe. When a considerable depth
l of oil has appeared on the surface
I skim il 1 iff with a spoon, being care
ful not to disturb the turbid juice be
low the oil until the last skimming.
Then when 1 have got all the clear oil
I take about an inch of the juice off
and place it in a small open vessel to
ne skimmed again later.
For tillering the oil 1 use a common
tin funnel, lining il with galvanized
mosquito netting and using common
tiller paper, procurable at any drug
store.
I suppose that I get only about half
Hie oil out of the olives by Ibis meth
od. hut what 1 gel is far superior lo
anything that can he bought on the
market. it is the first new virgin
oil. The last run under heavy hy
draulic pressure is not really til for
table use. lull the manufacturers mix
it in with Hie virgin oil, thereby in
creasing the volume at Ihe expense of
the quality.

fornia Indians, under a treaty signed
by the United Slates and Mexico in
tB.‘?H, have the right to vote and have
the same status as an American citizen,
is the contention of the defense in a
habeas corpus action being heard in
the federal district court. The action
seeks to have transferred to the su
perior court of Riverside from the local
federal jurisdiction the eases of Ani
brosie Apapas and nine other Indians
charged with the murder of William B.
Stanley. Indian agent. The ground for
the transfer is llial the defendants are
American citizens, made so by a treaty
signed after the war between the
I niled Sates and Mexici. February 25.
1838. The case is regarded as most
important by the government, and Dud

States attorney, has been selected to
argue the ease.

has no designs on (lie Philippines, ai
though national pride might urge fak
ing possession of Hie archipelago. It

SEATTLE, Bee. i. -N. Yatsushiro,
manager of the Sumi Tonu bank of
Osaka. Japan, who is studying the con
dition of Japanese on the Pacific coast,
believes exclusion lias been beneficial
to his countrymen residing in America.
""The effect of exclusion has been In
improve the condition of the Japanese
in this country,” said Mr. Aatsushira.
“Before the exclusion order they came
here to slay only a short time. Now
they hope to make their homes hero.
The result is a higher standard among
them. 1 think the Japanese laborers
are responsible for whatever anti-Jap
anese sentiment there may be here.
Most of them are rough, uneducated
farmers and do not understand that

Japanese in this country to teach these

The East High Line Canal
Will Irrigate 100,000
Acres of Land.
Does your desert entry lie under this canal?
The East High Line Canal will irrigate 100,000 acres of land. Does
your Desert Entry lie under this canal?
Imperial Water Company No. 5 offers 54,000 shares of water stock at
$lO per share cash. This price will prevail until January 1. 1913. when
the price will be advanced to $12.50 per share.
The unsold stock, 54,000 shares, will not cover all the land that will
be under the East High Line canal, hence it should be quickly under
stood by entrymen that this is the time to buy.
A mutual water company like No. 5 cannot be forced to deliver
water to any land not covered by water stock in Imperial Water Com
pany No. 5. so if you miss this opportunity to buy stock and so fail to
secure water it will be your own fault.
No commissions will be paid for selling stock, no graft, no bonus to
the C. D. Co., nor to any other person. This is an absolutely People’s
effort.
Cement head gates will be used, meaning stability and less cost of
maintenance.
If the water now wasting in the Alamo River is not put to a bene
ficial use quickly it will be lost forever to Imperial Valley.

Rochester Begins Like All New Camps
EVERYTHING MUST BE ON THE SQUARE, IS RULL
MARK TWAIN AND BRET
HARTE SHOULD RETURN
TO ENJOY THE REVELS
Like Roaring Gimp, Angels and Other Frontier Camps of
Gold Rush Days, Men Are Free and Boisterous, and
There Is Very Little Order, but There Is No Lawless
ness and the Towns Are Beginning to Be Staid and
Settled Down, and the Prospects of Prosperity Are
Encouraging.
Tf the* spirits of Mark Twain and Bret
Rarte are permitted to embrace the
earth In their nebulous wanderings,
their frequent abiding place must be
in the shade of the tents and cabins
Rt Rochester. The author of the
Jumping , Frog , of Calaveras,"" and the
bard who sang of Angels Camp, would
revel in word pictures of frontier days
•ome back again If they could but wield
*'legible pen Instead of the one with
which they are, no doubt, writing the
=uperearthly chronicles.
For Rochester is* Roaring Camp, Gal
lup, TVinslow, Sonora and Tuolumne all
•omblned In a wholesale resurrection of
(he days when the gold ferver was pass
ing through its early symptoms in the
west. Undoubtedly the most Interest
ing part of the camp Is the night life.
There is a fascination in Its weirdness,
its , unconventional ways, Its wanton
ness and its freedom. Throughout the
day prospectors scour the hills, mm•
-• - drill through rock that resembles
In its hardness, and men in their
nrious occupations undergo hardships,
■\posure and fatigue. When night
onie.""= they seek relaxation.
NO ARISTOCRACY
There are no theaters** no reading:
rooms, no churches, but there are sa
oons, dance halls and gambling places.
if is all open aorid above board. There is
i> Mdinj? of these pastimes. The
't-isrht lights flickering In front of
tents i j .nd cabins , beckon the tired miner
and the prospector. ""Within the re
ports there is warmth and companion
ship and men in mining camps, without
estraint. without amusement, seek
narmth and companionship. It Iβ hu
ature and that is what makes the
isht life bo alluring. All are on a

cook, the prospector associates with
the gambler. There is no segregation.
All are thrown together and this very
melting pot makes a scene which is
strangely alluring.
Rochester is not unlike every other
mining camp which has ever sprung
up in Nevada in almost a night. It has
its rough, unrefined, unpolished aspect.
An auto truck loaded with three tons
of freight pulled Into Rochester. On
the top of the load were 15 passengers.
There were saloon men, gamblers,
roustabouts, prospectors, miners and
clerks. It was a crowd that in any
other community would have occa
sioned astonishment, but In Rochester
it was taken as a matter of course.
Such is the freedom of a mining com
munity.
\O TIME FOR SLEEP
All night the saloons are open, gam
bling in full swing, and around the
stoves which throw out their genial
warmth in the drink emporiums col
lects a motley crowd of camp follow
ers ever ready to respond to an invi
tation Jto ""have a drink.""
On tables, benches, chairs', hanging ,
limply over barrels, boxes and any
other handy object are men fact asleep.
They seek the saloons for the warmth
of the stoves and nap. They stretch
on the floor when the chairs and
benches are occupied. It Is a sight
common in mining campe. In one sa
loon around the table are eight men
playing ""Big Indian."" the gambling
game which is now the most popular.
Before them is , stacked gold and silver
and under the pile, greenbacks. The
play is brisk. In ""Big Indian"" money
moves rapidly. Tt is not a poor man's
game and neither is Rochester a poor
man's camp. Tt costs money to play
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. MARCH 9. 1913 r
$1,450 Ore in Lincoln Hill
The latest development in the Rochester district has fairly startled
the mining world. Last Thursday news was telegraphed to San Fran
cisco that 38 inches of ore taken from the Abe Lincoln claim, on Lin
coln peak, has run $1,450 to the ton.
This news is taken to prove that the ore does not run all to one
place—Nenzel mountain. There has been some uncertainty as to the
prospects on the neighboring hill, Lincoln mountain, but this uncer
tainty is dissolved by the assay of the 38 inch ore shipped Thursday.
There is now no doubt that Lincoln peak will prove as great a bonanza
as Nenzel mountain.
The effect of this announcement has been a rush of prospectors
from the environs of Nenzel mountain to the lower stretches of the
other hill. Work on claims which had not been touched already has
startled, and the activities on the claims near the summit Jjave been
doubled. Tunnels are being pushed in, and shafts sunk, with a vigor
that has not marked a mining camp since Goldfield days. With Lincoln
peak showing up as well as Nenzel mountain, the glory that has been
Tonopah's is sure to crown the new camp, leaving Tonopah second
place in the list of permanent strikes.
""Big , Indian"" Just as It cost money to
drive tunnels through solid rock to
reach a vein of ore eight feet distant.
OH, THAT PIAXO!
In one saloon which assumes the
dignity of a dancing- hall because it
possesses a piano, the piano player is
too far gone from the effects of the
night's business to even see the keys.
He hangs helpless over a barrel, and
no amount of coaxing can Induce him
to stagger over to the piano and grind
out a tune. But the piano does not
lack for players. Other fingers can
""tickle the keys."" and they do. It is
near daylight, but one hour is as good
as another in a mining camp where ex
citement runs , high.
There are saloons doing business in
the lower town whose bar tenders can
hardly distinguish between the bottle
and the cork. The early part of the
evening is too strenuous. In one sa
loon it is necessary to drag the bar
tender away from his' berth by the
stove. He swears under his breath
when each member of the party calls
for a different kind of drink. It takes
a half hour to serve it. but there are
no sleeping accommodations to be had
at that hour and time must be killed
until daylight. The saloon is too hos
pitable to be ignored.
Some day the town will settle down
to be a staid, business like community.
Goldfleld has , ; Leadville did, and Roar
ing Camp is now a village of such
claims to respectability as a half a
dozen churches, a town jail and a.
""squire."" But, somehow, these towns
have lost their \romance, and that will
be the case with Rochester. As the
prospectors become men with hoards
of money In the bank, and the leasers
who now care for nothing but their
proximity to ""the vein."" turn their at
tention to the town bite and sell lots,
while their hired men are digging on
the hill, law and order will enter in
and less noise will echo from out the
saloon doors. Then another mining
camp will have passed into history, to
have in its stead a shafted, smoke
stacked ""city,"" with a depot and a
hotel with an elevator in it. and only
the sound of chugging machinery to
remind the pioneers of the clicking
of the picks of the earlier days.
BIG GREEN CAR GIVES
GOOD EXPRESS SERVICE
Motor Stage From Lovelock
Driven 5,000 Miles With
out a Single Mishap
Express service from Lovelock to
Rochester has been established. It is
an especial kind of express service,
the modern idea of what a stage line
should be. There is no pair of teame,
no driver with gun poised across his
knee on the watch for highwaymen—
just a speedy, big green car of the
Chalmers type, with the proprietor
driver at the wheel. This P. D. is a
keen eyed, steady nerved young chap,
who has the record of having , driven
5,000 miles back and forth between
Rochester and Lovelock, with all kinds
of freight, human and mineral, with
never an accident to mar the trip along
the treacherous mountain and desert
roads.
When Rochester shall have become a
staid business community there will
be many legends of these days told to
regale the successors of the present
pioneers, and among- these miners' tales
will be stories of Oroville Marker, the
aforementioned P. D., which will be
quite Important items in modern auto
mobile lore. For there is hardly one
of the men who are making fortunes
hand over ftet in the Rochester district
who has not made the Irlp from Love
lock to Rochester in the ""big green
car , ' of Marker's, swapping prospects
along the way, or in conversational
gambling upon the future of the new
mining camp.
NO WILDCATTING
TO BE ALLOWED
J. T. Donnellan Declares
New Camp Will Stand
for Truth Only
John T. Donnellan, one of the mining
experts of San Francisco, and one of
the pioneers of Goldfield, expresses
himself as flrm in the belief that Roch
ester is destined to be one of the great
est camps in the Sagebrush state. He
said yesterday:
""I have been through a half dozen or
more booms since Goldfleld, but there
never has , been any that Impressed me
more than Rochester. The new camp of
Nevada has as rich and big a surface
showing as any camp I ever saw, and
it gives every indication of going down
strong and of becoming another Tono
pah. It is. evident that this impression
prevails elsewhere, for the camp Is at
tracting big capital and there Is abun
dant money coming in for development
purposes'.""
Mr. Donnellan is the secretary of the
Rochester Crown Point Mines com
pany, whose territory is located in the
heart of the best part of the camp as
far as developed, and which has also a
long term lease upon a block of the
Nenzel property, which contains a part
of the vein system that has made the
Xenzel property what it is today.
On the Crown Point ground the com
pany has attained a depth of 42 feet
by shaft, sending the shaft ln # ore all
the way. The ore has been sacked to
a value of $60 per ton, the lower grades
being consigned to the' dumps for
future disposition. Mr. Donnellan
states that there are three men now in
the camp bent tipon installing mill fa
cilities for the district, and it Is to the
company's interests to set aside its
lower grade ores for milling, as there
is no limit set upon the removal of the
dumps in the contract of leasing.
The strength of the veins, and the
fact that the silver values predominate
over the gold, are factors that go to
convince those knowing Rochester that
the camp will be permanent with depth.
The croppings on the Crown Point
property pan as wide as 40 feet In
places , , and the croppings are extremely
bold, as can be seen by the numerous
photographs in the possession of Mr.
Donnellan.
The camp Is attracting , enormous
crowds, and those having , the interests
of the district at heart are determined
to prevent wildcatting In every way
possible. Mr. Donnellan says that all
figure the camp is , good enough when
gauged by actual conditions, and there
will not be permitted any orgy of
Illegitimate promotions.
C.H. M'INTOSH HEADS
FOUR NEW COMPANIES
Ready to Finance All Propo
sitions That Look Good
—And Many Do
The Rochester Mining Development
company was the first corporation of
its kind to put in an appearance in
the Rochester district and was formed
for the purpose of forwarding the min
ing development of the district by
financing all likely looking proposi
tions that might be brought forward.
This company is the fourth one pro
moted by.C. H. Mclntosh, who has be
come heavily interested in, the camp
and who has already formed three com
panies to work properties , which he
has taken over. It is a close corpora
tion, with Mclntosh as president; J. E.
McCreary, vice president; W. C. Pitt,
secretary and- treasurer. John Cleg
horn, one of the best practical miners
in the state, is manager of mine exami
nations for the company In the Inves
tigations of all properties.
McCreary is a retired oil capitalist of
Coalinga, Cal., and is , one of the wealth
iest ""men Interested In the camp. He
has been associated with Melntosh and
Pitt in their recent purchases and has
apparently decided to take up perma
nent interests in the camp and stay
with it for better or for worse.
The company was incorporated with
100,000 shares of stock at $1 per share
and $60,000 was fully subscribed, the
balance, or 40,000 shares, went Into the
treasury.
The purpose of the company is gen
eral exploration of the Rochester dis
trict and the looking over of all meri
torious propositions. The promotion
and building of a mill or mills will
come within the province of this com
pany.
This company has a department of
information with reliable information
about the camp for all who seek defi
nite mining Information.
ELY MEN TAKE OVER FIVE
CLAIMS FOR $25,000 CASH
ROCHESTER, March B.—Mining
and business men of Ely, Nev., took
hold of the Lake View group, compris
ing five claims, for a consideration of
$25,000. The View group, for
merly belonged to Sweeney & Dewitz.
This group is situated on Independence
hill, and right in the heart of Roches
ter. Big surface showings of high
value stand out prominently, and a
strong vein 5 feet in width is stripped
for 7i feet. The new owners will sink
a shaft 100 feet in depth Just as fast
as they can possibly get around to it.
The group has attracted considerable
attention from mining men in general.
TEN THOUSAND TONS
IN SIGHT IN BIG FOUR
One Lease Alone to Ship Ore
for Years to Come, Is
Prediction
Ten thousand tons of ore In nlpht
In the Big Four leajre on Nenxel peak*
with an eight foot vein running to an
average of $75 to the top, and the tun
nel of the Codd lease of th« Rochester
Hill* Mining company SO feet from th*
same ledge are indications of the pert
manency of the new camp of Rochester
and the bona fide support of the boost*
ing of the last few days. The Big Fou*
tunnel has been In ore for many weeks
and at last accounts had reached •
width of 12 feet.
The news has not been of a »n«*
tional nature, as the direct result*
prophesied by those familiar ■with the
outcroppings on Nenzel peak have ooma
to pass. The vein has widened and
the ore has become richer in lt« down
ward course and there is now not the
slightest doubt that the Rochester
Hills Mining company on the Codd
lease will strike the same ledge at the
same if not richer values.
The conclusions from the develop*
ments of the last week are simply to
the effect that the camp is assured of
shipping ore for years from these two
leases alone, and this conclusion is
reached in spite of the fact that devel
opment work has Just begun.
In addition to the siiowlngs on these
two properties, which may have been,
and promise to be the mainstay of the
camp, there are some excellent find
ings on other leases on the Crown
Point No. 1, besides many important
discoveries of the last week on ether
properties of the district.
VBRINGTOX COPPER MOTES
The Yerington Mountain Copper com
pany, operating about 12 miles east of
Yerington, has Its spur track on the
Nevada-California road, this side of
Schurz, completed and Is putting In ore
bins at an expense of about $2,000.
When these are completed the property
wlll be a heavy producer. Several thou
sand tons of ore are now piled on th»
dump at the mine awaiting hauling to
the railroad to be shipped to the smel
ter. This ore was all taken out In de
velopment work and the property is
proving - to be one of the big onea of
this district.
W. B. Boulter rave C. W. Geddes an
option on the Queen Charlotte group
of seven claims in the Mason Pass sec
tion. The price is $15,000 and the bond
is for one year. The sum of $2,000 was
paid down and the agreement call 3 for
a certain amount of work to be done
during the life of option. These claim*
are an extension of the McDonald
ground which Geddes already had un
der bond. There are some fine show

The New Year’s party is char
| aetcri/'cd by noise and merriment.
1 Hons mid whistles and bells are
,-1 as essential a part of the plans
.s the guests ~r the refreshments.
One i t the in os i joli.v New A car’s
•Vi celebrations that we ever at
tended was a two faced party. 1 lie
gin w . a -kc' I ' come dressed
in don - with masks, one for tlie
back of the hind to face the old
vc i mill one for the front to look
forward into the new year. Oil
ai riving each guest was given a
number to pin on and a card con
taining a Lst of all the numbers,
■no. when nil were assembled a
i nti'sj wa - held t guess who was
who. I:i order t> give the guessers
a duo to the identity of the indi
vid :ais. cadi person was requested
to recite this favorite New- Year
poem: v *•""
•ii.cg out the lid, ring in the new,
Ring happy hells across the snow;
The vein is going, let him go.
King out the false, ring in the true.”
One person with a black false
face recited it in negro dialect, one
w'th n little girl’s face lisped the
nes and one man who wore a
indy's face tried to recite it in a
deceiving falsetto tone, all of which
added to the fun.
After each guest had written his
guesses opp -ite the numbers on
the card, given him at the begin
gof th e itest, the face masks
were iimoved, but the one on the
Li i k of the head was left oil.
I : ere was a prize, of course, for
;he person who guessed the identity
of the greatest number of persons.
Games followed, ninny of which
w. , arranged ti be played back
ward. There was a snowball Idttie
with .-nowballs made of cotton bnt
' eg sprinkled with artificial snow.
The guests, divided into two sides,
were lined up with the masks on
the hack of of their heads facing
towa.d each otlo r. In this position
tiny threw th snowballs from one
side . * the other.
A gi -at deal of fun was derived
from making the guests, one at a
time, try to wall; a elialkliiie with
the false face forward, which really
meant walking backward.
Just before twelve, favors wore
distributed.. They consisted of pa
per hats and horns, mouth organs,
drums, whistles and bells, and as
t! ,- clock struck the witching hour
of midnight a no'-y parade started
which ended as the supper table.
A men i suitable for such a party

Public Notice
To Everyone In The Valley
Are You Thinking of Buying a New Machine?
Before You Do, There Is a Lot of Things to Learn
The selling of sewing machines is unlike that of any other
merchandising scheme. If you know the ropes; however, there
is not so much danger of being taken in.
While warmed up with enthusiasm the average machine
agent does not mention the weak points of his machine. He is too
interested in you giving him $75.00 to $150.00 for a new machine,
that might not do as well as your old one.
I’m your benefactor. From me you’ll get BOTH sides of the
story. I will prove that your old machine can be cleaned and
made to serve your purpose BETTER than a new one.
I Am Interested In You.
I will give you advice, help and consultation for which I never
charge a penny. Fourteen years ago I dedicated rpy life to help
people. It is a profession with me. John £), Mrs.
Newton D. Baker, wife of General McQuigg, and
other delighted customers would quickly tell you what 1 did for
them. •' ~ v 1 "" ;
: *:IS , . .
Ninety-nine per cent of the sewing machines'in Imperial
County should be cleaned and overhauled. But you are jtist like
everyone else, afraid to call in a sewing machine agent,'because
you know what they always try to do.
Like a Big Brother, I will protect you against seivlng ma
chine fakers and others who are just after your money. When I
say I will overhaul your machine and give it a thbrotigh French
Cleaning right in your own home for almost nothing, (just
$1.90;) when the regular price is $5.00, prdves that rtloney is no
object to me during this advertising campaign/ 1 *'' '
Expect to be busy in my room at the hotel most of,the time
evenings till 9 o’clock until Wednesday. Suppose you call
up and give me your name? I know just how you feel about the
matter, so I promise to come and givfe your machine a FREE
examination. The things I do for you will make you happy—
you 11 say so yourself. A perfect running machine is a God-Send.
Call in person, write or phone your name AT QNCE.

SOCIAL SI LEST SIGHTS
A recent Webster cartoon depicting ""the thrill
that comes once in a lifetime” showed a young man
draped in apparent comfort on a stuffed sofa, read
ing a book. A table at his sde held some simple but re
freshing viands. The legand read :
“The pre-.iazz era wlven a dish of apples, a pitcher
of cider and a copy of T reasure Island constituted an
evening’s entertainment.”
Ot course a strong minded person even in the jazz
era ought to be able to choose his own evening’s enter
tainment and map it out on just such simple lines any
time he wishes, But that is difficult. It always seems
like flying in the face of modern civilization to ignore
the concerts and plays and movies and various other
opportunities offered nightly to an eager public, hiven
if one can harden his heart against commercial enter
tainment. it seems difficult to decline a neighborly in
vitation to come in for an evening of bridge or dancing
or radio. And so humankind rushes torth indiscrim
inately to everything and anything that is labeled en
tertainment. and the thrill of the apples, the book and
the couch goes unfelt but not unyearned for.
Here's a suggestion which any community might
adopt in order to revive the old regime. There are now
occasional “silent nights” on the radio to permit of
some special program being enjoyed without interrup
tion. Why not have social silent nights, too, when there
will be no entertaining, no concerts, no shows, and
when everybody who so desires can enjoy an old
fashioned evening without feeling guilty?
WISDOM IXSTEAD OF DIAMOSDS
Mississippi almost had a “diamond rush.” It was
rumored recently that diamonds had been found in
that state and that there were a lot more still to be
found. It might have produced as much excitement as
the current Canandian gold rush. But it didn't.
In the first place, the newspapers of the state re
fused to get excited about the announced discovery.
They expressed themselves as capable of great pleas
ure if the rumor proved to be well founded, but they
saw no reason for a premature'boom and waited pleas
antly to be shown the diamonds.
Now there is still a great deal of talk of dia
monds, although the excitement has blown over and
the “discoverer” shows no signs of any further inter
est in his search. But the taik is mostly philosophical.
One speaker is typical of many.
“If it should turn out that there are no diamond
mines ir. Pike county, the people can truly say that
they have something ‘just as good.’ Not only have
■they plenty to eat, good homes, good churches, but they
have what the Bible declares better than much fine
gold.” i
The commodity referred to is wisdom. It is bet
ter than gold and diamonds together.
A novel form of bee culture is carried on in De
Soto parish in Louisiana where ‘.here are swamps full
of honey plants from March to September. Formerly
it was considered hopeless to try to raise bees there be
cause the swamps could be penetrated only by boats
and there was often danger of floods and overflow.
Then the extension department of the state university
tackled the problem.
Bee yards now placed along numerous bayous
out in the swamps, set on scaffolds, and cared for by
keepers who use boats drawing very little water and
capable of entering even the most remote parts of a
swamp. There are now about 8000 hives, and the prac
tice is growing.
Draining swamps to put them under cultivation is
often a lengthy and expensive task. Sometimes, too, it
is found that their soil is not really suitable for gen
eral farming after it has been reclaimed. This bee
culture plan is therefore doubly interesting, increasing
the production of honey and utilizing otherwise unpro
ductive areas.
To the various “little playhouses” operating in
and around Now York City i.s now added a ‘‘little opera
house.”
The Opera !\>ycrs, Inc., has bet n organized to pre
sent opera on a mefctest scale to the metropolis and the
provinces. It will <fpen the middle of March in a the
ater built especally lor it. seating only 290 persons.
rhis. it i hoped, will be the beginning of many
such institutions in the United Stales, to minister to
local musical demands of a music hungry people and
serve as training schools for prima donnas. From them
should come, in time, many a Marion Talley. Poss
ibly, too, an occasional Caruso or Chaliapin.
Lieutenant Byrd ought to succeed in living to the
Pole, if anybody can.
Science- at last discovers how to foil mosquitoes.
It’s very simple, as explained by De. Rudolphs of
Rutgers University to an audience of mosquito bitten
New Jerseyites. ou may mix insect powder extract
with vaseline, rub it on thick, and then the skeeters
won’t bite you for two hours.
Eastward the course of culture takes Us way. The
leading American exhibits at the lair in Leipsig, Ger
many, are automobiles and chewing gum.
Count Slam has taken his last look at his baby and
.started back for Europe to play tennis; and if he wants
to keep in the limelight, we suggest that he form an
■offensive ami defensive alliance with Suzanne Lenglen.

Mussolini is toting a sackful of dynamite on his
back and daring the world to kick it.

DIRECTOR BRENNON
WITH NOAH BEERY
AT LEGION SHOW
Famous Picture People
to Appear Personally
on The Legion Stage.
Herbert Brennon, who is direct
ing the filming of Beau Gcstj*, the
Famous Players I.asky picture on
the sand hills between Iloltvill,. mu. l
Yuma, is a staunch friend of the ex
service man in gencal and of tln*
American Legion iu particular.
Brennon heard that Boyce Aten
post of th's city is producing a
minstrel show next week, and lie
extended an offer to the committee
in charge ol’ the show to help out
n ii iiway possible.
The offer was readily accepted
and Brennon with a number of the
actors appearing in the film, will lie
present on tin; stage for at least one
of the performances. Brennon ex
pressed the hope that the film folks
might get oxer to K! Centro for
both nights of the minstrel, but as
every minute counts in producing a
picture, it nun not lie poxsihili- to
spare the time to link: 1 tx\ n trips.
Brennon ""s generous offer was
made to Lloyd Sickles, who is di
reefing the minstrel and Attorney
Ld llervev, when lhi\ visited the
movie camp vesterdav.
The director is recognized as one
of the leaders in moving picture
circles. Beceiit screen successes
which were produced under his sii
perv ision include, “Little French
Girl,” “Sired of Forgot ten Men,’’
“Kiss For Cinderella, * ’ “Song and
Dance Man,’’ and “ llaneing Moth

-yet Unmatched
Smoothness
Sixty miles an hour and more is not uncommon among ablomotor
cars. But sixty miles and more with perfect smoothness and steadi
ness is rare—so rare as to be virtually exclusive to the Oakland Six.
This unmatched freedom from vibration at all speeds is made
possible by a new invention, The Harmonic Balancer, described by
automotive engineers as the outstanding achievement in years.
Ifyou have not seenTheHarmonic Balancer—if you have not tested
its amazing effect upon car performance—drive the new Oakland
Six and experience the new thrill of an unvarying smoothness.

sign
In the home, or at the club— in
busy office or crowded street —
whenever friend meets friend, you
will hear that magic invitation—
have a Camel!
And wherever Camels are
lighted, men come together in
more friendly understanding, No
other cigarette ever had or made
so many friends or brought so
much added friendliness to the
world as Camel, for Camel’s quality
is a universal language.
Camel is more than a cigarette.
It is an experience in smoking en
joyment —the finest this old earth
affords. Camels contain the choic
est Turkish and Domestic tobaccos
grown, and these f.ne tobaccos are
superbly Clcnded, as in no other
cigarette. The enjoyment of
Camels goes on forever, for they
never tire the taste no matter how
liberally you smoke them. They
simply never leave a cigaretty after
taste. No other cigarette in the
world is like them. Millions of ex
perienced smokers who could well
afford to pay more will buy and
smoke only Camels.
Whenever and wherever you
meet a friend, let that be a stand
ing invitation to the sheerest en
joyment that ever came from a
cigarette.
Have a Camel!

RULES WOULD BAN
LAWMAKERS’ TRICKS
SACRAMENTO. May 18. (U.R)—
Tricky legislative procedure which
tends to lengthen session and in
crease the cost of lawmaking will
be abolished In California next
year if the 62nd legislature adopts
the changes recommended by an
interim committee on rules.
While members of the present
legislature awaited a call to a
special session to meet the emer
gency relief situation, the com
mittee headed by Assemblyman
Charles W. Lyon, Los Angeles,
administration floor leader last
year, completed recommendations
which will be submitted at the
January session.
Proponents Confident
If adopted - and members of the
committee were confident the
legislature would approve the
changes—there will be no more
clock-stopping, no more morning
sessions of the assembly. Lobby
ists will be denied the privilege
of visiting members on the floor.
The following regulations are
proposed:
1. Committee meetings will be
held each morning from 9 a.m. un
til noon. Assembly sessions will
start at 2 p.m. and extend, if
necessary into the evenings.
2. New members will not have
their pet measures killed by a
motion to lay an amendment on
the table—a maneuver used fre
quently in the past to catch an
inexperienced member unawares
and stop his bill.
3. Adjournment will be fixed
seven days in advance by the
adoption of a resolution, and there
will be no clock stopping to per
mit the extension of the session

FOES OF ‘QREEN HELL’ MADE CHIEFS
BY LATIN AMERICAN REVOLUTIONS
NO BUCKSHOT FILLS NEW CALAVERAS
CHAMPION IN FROG LEAP CONTEST
ANGELS CAMP, Cal., May 13.
(U.R)—Citizens of Angels c. :np. min
ing center on the golden trail of
the mother lode, felt themselves
fully vindicated today for the trim
ming a pair of pity slickers gave
their gray-bearded grandfathers
and the city's frog jumping cham
pion in the gold rush days.
Ever since Ma-k Twain took pen
in hand to make a perpetual rec
ord of that trimming the men, and
the women, too. of the mining camp
have been waiting for a chance to
get back at the “furriner ”,
Their moment came yesterday,
when a home-owned jumper, in
correctly named ‘‘Can't Take It,’
LOCAL RETAIL
STORE IS 71ST
FOR SEARS CO.
When El Centro's new Sears,
Roebuck and company retail store
opens its doors at 737 Main street
next Thursday morning, it will be
come the seventy-first Sears store
doing business on the Main streets
of the nation.
That was one of the interesting
sidelights about his firm given by
H. J. Heisch. manager of the new
local retail enterprise.
‘‘Of course our company operates
a great many more stores than 71,”
Heisch said, ""but I believe the fact
has never been brought out before
that so many of them are actually
located along Main street.. To me
it typifies th P way Sears, Roebuck
and company has carried its mer
chandising service closer and closer
to the people of the United States,
making their job of buying increas
ingly simpler and easier.
""Think of a Main street with 71
stores along its two sides some
large complete department stores,
other smaller stores handling prin
cipally the so-called “hard” lines,
and you will get some conception
of the Sears mythical Main street.
Earning;; of the employes of these
Main street stores alone would be
enough to support a population as
large as that of El Centro and the
establishments could supply the
main merchandise needs for hun
dreds of thousands of people.
""There are Sears stores on the
Main streets of cities in 26 different
states and all of them we believe
through th e expenditures they make
for wages, newspaper advertising,
rent and taxes, contribute their
shale toward keeping Main street
facing forward.""
Workmen have been winding up
their remodeling and redecorating
program at the ne>.v store site.
Heisch said Monday the extensive
interior alterations and improve
ments in the building had about
been completed and that the en
tire job would be finished well hi
advance of the opening day.
took the main prize in the annual
Calaveras jumping frog contest.
Safely guarded by Angel Camp
citizens, .'.earing the whiskers,
plaid shirts and trousers-tucked
in boots of the mining heydey,
""Can't Take It” leaped 12 feet, 3
inche to beat an outlander from
the Will Roger.; ranch in Oklahoma
named ""Jack Dalton"" by one skin
ny inch.
The guards made well certain
that no one introduced buckshot
into 'Can't Take It” digestive sys
tem, as had the slickers who put
► one over on the pioneer settlers in
Twain’s day.
Third and Fourth places also
went to Angels Camp to make the
citizenry feel prouder than they
had for years. Joe Mendalo's “Dis
covery"" was third with 11 feet. 11
| inches and Elwin Lillie's Red Can
|V took fourth with 11 feet, 4 in
ches.

COURT UPHOLDS
I AH. SENTENCE
FOR LAWMAKER
WASHINGTON. May 18. <U.R>—
The District of Columbia court of
appeals today ruled that Rep. John
H. Hoeppel, D.. Cal., and his son,
Charles, must serve from four
months to one year in prison for
conspiring to sell an appointment
to West Point for SI,OOO.
The Hoeppels had appealed a Dis
trict of Columbia supreme court
conviction, contending that the
statute under which they were
prosecuted did not cover the charge
against them.
James W. Ives, a Baltimore. Md..
Olympic athlete, accused them of
oeking to sell him an appointment
to the military academy. Ives gave
young Hoeppel a promissory note,
and then refused to pay w’hen he
learned his appointment was un
lawful.
Hoeppel said that he would file
a motion for a rehearing before
the court of appeals because its an
nouncement today failed to decide
“all of the questions raised on my
appeal.” He said he would be a
candidate for re-election despite the
conviction and “will be proud to
take my record before the voters.”

TREE PLANTING
SUGGESTED NOW
FOR EL CENTRO
Mrs. J. S. Jones, chairman of
the El Centro chamber of com
merce tree planting committee,
suggested Monday that those who
purchase small palo verde trees
and flowering oleanders from the
nursery of the Future Farmers of
America at Central Union high
school immediately set out and
| vater these trees.
With reasonable care, every tree
now set out will live, although the
season is somewhat advanced. They
should be given plenty of water for
a few days, and if possible a light
shade, such as a shin.«’e or paper
shelter placed close to the plant
but not too close to cut off the air
so that the direct rays of the sun
may be Kept away for a few days,
Mrs. Jones said.
The oleanders and palo verdes.
according to Paul Thornton of the
high school, are in excellent con
dition for planting. The number
is so limited that it has been found
necessary to limit the sale of these
ornamental trees to those who 'will
plant them in the parkways along
the street or in front yards where
they are visible to passers-by.

Bolivian Army Uprising
Puts in Fascist Leader
LA PAZ. May 18 <U.R) —Two army officers who fought each othed
in the bloody Gran Chaco War, headed the governments of Bolivia]
and Paraguay today. An army revolt identical to the recent one in|
Paraguay, unseated the Bolivian government yesterday in a bloodless
coup. It left in charge the men who fought the war and have deter-
mined on a real new deal for the*
ragged, destitute men who are
drifting back from the steaming
jungles where they fought for three
years.
Col. Jose David Toro, 45, is head
of the Bolivian army in the field.
He is expected here today by air
plane from the Chaco region be
tween Villa Montes and Vilazon
where he has traveling.
Pending his arrival to assume
the provisional presidency, a rev
olutionary junta took charge of
the government after the resigna
tion of President Jose Luis Tejada
Zorzano.
Toro was an outstanding figure
in the Chaco war, in which he
frequently was directly opposed
to Col. Rafael Franco.
Franco took the oath as provi-
prints, federal bureau of investiga
tion agents revealed today.
In addition to mutilating his
fingers with a powerful acid, he re
moved the tatooed bust of a cow
girl from his left forearm but agents
said he has been identified posi
tively as a long-hunted fugitive
wanted in various parts of the coun
try.
They said he would be returned
to the Vermont town where he is
under indictment with Edward
Bence, recently arrested in New
York, on charges of robbing the
Caledonia National bank, Oct. 10.
1934. He also was said to be charged
with robbing the First National
Bank of Branden, Vt., on the same
day.
Simons was arrested here as he
was strolling along a downtown
street.
According to agents, his long
successful evasion from capture
was made possible by his use of
numerous names and periodic trips
to South America. He employed
more than a dozen aliases and was
operating under the name of James
L. Ripley when arrested here.

he would be happy to resume his

imperial valley press.,['El Centro'],1936-12-27,"What Mammy Pleasant’s Sinister Power?
The Story of Mammy Pleasant Began 88 Years Ago in San Francisco and Continued
Through the Pre-Civil War South and Into Houses of 11l Repute, and Ended the Way
of Most Stories as Mammy Died in Poverty.
By Virginia Munn Finch
IT WAS called the ""House of Mystery”!
Strange, unnatural things happened there—
intrigue, tragedy, death! But strangest of all
was the power of the old Negro woman who
lived in the house. From this eerie dwelling at
1661 Octavia Street in San Francisco, the
shrewd and crafty Negress whom the world
knew as Mammy Pleasant, ruled not only the
Thomas Bel) family for whom she ostensibly
worked, but half the politicians in the State of
California. Even a governor came under her
strange power—a power that she carried with
her to her grave.
Intrigue coupled with mystery from time im
memorial has captured the attention of people.
There is an elusive fascination about whomso
ever or whatsoever is shrouded in the cloak of
the unknown. Suspense is exciting—the more
suspense and the longer it is sustained, the more
exciting. That's why the story of Mammy Pleas
ant is still told today. Mammy is long since
dead, but the strange tales of mystery and scan
dal connected with her, walk like ghosts in the
minds of the curious. Those who have heard
her story are still in suspense—kept guessing
at her secrets, which were the source of her
amazing power.
The story of Mammy begins 88 years ago,
at the time when the often-heard rumors that
gold had been discovered in California becamfe
fact, and untold thousands seeking fortune
flowed like endless streams into the West.
In the eventful year of 1848, there arrived
in San Francisco a young woman, Mary Ellen
Pleasant—quick wiited, shrewd and alert—who
was destined to become a notoriously well
known character, not only in the gold rush days
but throughout the remainder of the nineteenth
century. She was the “Mammy” Pleasant who
became one of the West’s most colorful figures
a forceful woman to whom power far super
seded wealth in importance. Both power and
wealth came to her through her ability to find
out things about the great and the near great
and to keep their secrets. Her story is one of
unfathomable intrigue, packed full of amazing
incidents, each flavored with its mystery, its
suspense, and its baffling denouement.
Born at Boston, in August 1814, Mary Ellen
Williams was the illegitimate child of a free
Louisiana Negress and a Cherokee Indian. She
was dark skinned, but mainly, her features were
dominated by her Indian blood, having the
prominent cheek bones, a high-bridged nose
and well-formed lips. Her eyes, however, were
astonishing! One was blue and the other brown!
Her childhood was most unhappy and wretched.
She begged on the streets. She was forced to
commit petty crimes and live mostly by her
wits. In her twentieth year, Lady Luck smiled
on her, and she met and married a well-to-do
free Cuban Negro named Alexander Smith. At
the time of his death in 1844, his estate totalled
$45,000, which he left to Mary Ellen with the
stipulation that some of this money be used
toward furthering the Abolition Movement
which was then sweeping over the country.
Two years after his death, Mary Ellen
Intrigue! Mystery! Tragedy! Death! Horror!
Tyrant Was John Brown’s Aide
again married, and this time it was one John
Pleasant, a former employee of the deceased
Smith. With him, she arrived in San Francisco
early in 1848. For a short time they lived to
gether, but soon he dropped out of her life,
probably because he couldn’t figure very attrac
tively in her plans for the future. It is known
that he died, and also that he was not mourned.
Shrewd as she was, it was only natural for
her to quickly take advantage of the many op
portunities to make a fortune that the early
gold rush days in San Francisco offered. Being
a splendid cook, she was in great demand and
it was not long before she was offered as much
as five hundred dollars a month for her serv
ices.
She decided, instead, to open a boarding
house for bachelors. Finding a house on Wash
ington Street, she lavishly furnished it, and had
as regular boarders and guests such men as
Newton Booth, Sharon, Broderick, Terry and
scores of other rising men of the moment Her
fame spread, and it was necessary as well as
profitable for her to open other houses of less
pretensions and less respectability. For it must
be said of Mammy that she not only set a fine
table but she also arranged with finesse all man
ner of entertainment —from cards and an occa
sional highball to female companionship. She
knew the tastes of her male boarders, and sup
plied them quickly and efficiently. Through such
tactics she intimately knew all the private in
discretions of these wealthy and prominent gen
tlemen, all of which gave her a tremendous
amount of power. Money rained down upon her.
It was common gossip that Mammy Pleasant
had decided that San Francisco was not to be
a city without women. Hence many houses ca
tering to less elite and cheaper trade, were ac
tually hers, but which she openly did not
acknowledge.
While busy with her own fortunes, Mammy
had not forgotten the stipulation of her first
husband to aid the slaves of America. She had
a genuine interest in securing their freedom,
not only as a cause, but also for the Negro as
a race. In 1858—10 years after her arrival in
San Francisco, she went to Boston, met John
Brown and gave him a check for $30,000 which
he was to use toward obtaining arms and am
munitions and completing plans for the revolt
of the Negroes against their owners.
Disguised as a jockey, sometimes in other
ways, Mammy went South, going from planta
tion to plantation, from state to state, organ
izing and converting Negroes to the cause, help
ing them escape to the North and Canada, via
the underground railway, and giving them food
and money to get across the Mason-Dixon Line.
All of this effort went for naught. John Brown’s
raid at Harper’s Ferry in October 1859 was
premature. He had not gotten in touch first
with Mammy as he had agreed. He Was cap
tured, tried and hanged and an active search was
made to find his accomplices. Consequently,
Mammy was forced to flee to New York where
she hid out for a time.
IT IS interesting to know that Mammy could
neither read nor write, although she did learn
to sign her own name. In one of John Brown’s
The Fatal Stair
way in the House
of Thomas Bell
at 1661 Octavia
Street.
Thomas Frederick Bell,

Settlement Was Penniless
and Sold Apples on San
Francisco Street Corners.
pockets was found a note, the message of which
was in one handwriting, and the signature,
“M. E. P.” in another. The message read, ""The
ax is laid at the root of the tree. When the
first blow is struck, there will be more money
to help.”
Disillusioned with her efforts to reform, this
ended, so far as is known. Mammy’s anti
slavery activities. Eventually, she returned to
San Francisco to resume management of her
houses.
Soon Mammy had dozens of then powerful
financial and political barons dancing at the end
of a string. They were her puppets and when
she pulled the strings they moved as she di
rected. Such a network of interlapping evidence
did she have against the political powers of the
State that she could indirectly influence dozens
of men whom she had never met. She figured
prominently in many police cases in which she
invariably cams out victorious.
There was one case in which a Negro hench
man of hers was hailed into court for perjury.
When the case seemed to be going against him,
Mammy jumped from her seat in the courtroom
and openly announced to the court that he
could not be sent to prison. She warned the
judge that if convicted, the man not only would
never serve a day in prison, but that the judge’s
own career on the bench would be at an end.
The frightened judge, of course, had no alterna
tive after this outbreak and with the evidence
as it was. The man was convicted and sen
tenced. But Mammy was right! Before he even
entered the gates of the prison, he received a
pardon. The judge soon dropped into oblivion.
Such was Mammy’s power.
Mammy’s house of ill repute at 920 Wash
ington Street was a favorite rendezvous for the
political and socially prominent men of the time.
Mammy cared for and educated an illegitimate
daughter of a one-time California governor, fol
lowing the mother's death. The Negress saw to
it that the girl’s father contributed so gener
ously that there was enough to promote other
causss than his daughter’s. In his will, the gov
ernor. then retired to private life, left his daugh
ter. without acknowledging her as such, a share
of his estate. Feeling that she had not been
left her just due, the girl, at the instigation of
Mammy, contested the will, won her case and
obtained a handsome settlement. There were
other cases—many of them—but Mammy is
more closely identified with the Bell family
than any other.
FOR years, a frequent visitor to Mammy’s
houses was a Scotchman, Thomas Bell. who.
previous to his arrival in San Francisco in
his early thirties, had held banking positions in
London and South America. A shrewd and
canny financier, he organized the brokerage firm
of Bell and Baron, which was the agent for the
Rothschilds of London and Paris. Later. he be
came the power behind Ralston in the Bank of
California in the Comstock days It was he. too,
who promoted and built the Guatemala or Cen
tral American Railway. His fortune was es
timated to run between 15 and 20 million dol
lars.
Thomas Bell had never married. He enjoyed
the free and easy life he had led without the
hampering bonds of matrimony. An inveterate
gambler, he made and lost fortunes at one sit
ting without batting an eye As he reached 50,
he was attracted to a protegee of Mammy’s, a
girl employed in one of Mammy's houses, whose
beauty brought down the most devoted atten
tions from many of the wealthy men of the
city. Mammy was quick to see that Thomas
Bell was interested in this girl, and as a result
engineered her plans so successfully that he
moved Teresa Clingan-Harris-Percy into his
home and permitted her to add his name to
the long list already hers.
Not long after, Mammy herself moved in
with them, and straightway took a firm hand
in ruling the domain. She planned an elaborate
home for the couple at 1661 Octavia Street.
Every detail of Mammy’s plans was carried out,
from the mansard roof, to the circular stair-
Thomas Bell, Multi-
Millionaire, Paid
$50,000 to His Wife
on the Birth of Each
Child. Rumor Has

Two Extra Children
to Collect Money
for Bell’s Wife.
vflay extending from the basement to the attic,
and the lavish ballroom lined with mirrors from
floor to ceiling.
It was Mammy who manipulated the mar
riage between Thomas and Teresa after they
had begun life in .their new home—that is, a
marriage ceremony performed by Father Bres
lin. a Catholic priest, but a ceremony for which
no civil license had been obtained.
Almost immediately there Ensued a vehement
quarrel between the newly-married pair, which
terminated’in Teresa’s hasty departure from the
house with bag and baggage. Bell had her ar
rested and returned and from then on they lived
in a divided house she on one side and he on
the other, with Mammy as the intermediary.
Alone in his side of the house Thomas Bell
brooded. If he had children his life would be less
lonely. But he was not on particularly good
terms with his wife. Mammy plotted with him.
It was decided that with each child Teresa pre
sented to Bell, she was to receive a cash settle
ment' of $50,000. As speedily as the laws of na
ture allowed, she produced six children—three
girls, Robina May, Muriel and Marie Teresa —
three boys, Reginald, Eustace and Thomas Fred
erick.
After Thomas Bell’s death great controversy
arose among his direct heirs over his will. It
was taken to court time and time again. In the
trial during September 1897, Mammy testified,
that Thomas Frederick and. Marie Teresa Bell
were not Teresa Clingan Bell’s own children.
That Thomas Bell had brought these children
as babies to the ranch where Mammy lived and
asked her to care for them a year before
Thomas Bell had married Teresa. This testi
mony all the more backed up the ugly rumors
which had circulated throughout the years that
all six children had not been borne by Teresa,
even though she was crafty enough to have col
lected a cool $300,000 on them, from her hus
band.
THROUGHOUT Mammy’s career, it is evident
that she not only directed and enjoyed steer
ing the Bell family's various intrigues among
its different members, but she took an especially
keen delight in arranging the affairs of others
as well.
In 1875, Senator Sharon became the enemy of
Thomas Bell when he secured the control of the
Bank of California after its failure. Probably
as a means of revenge, Mammy introduced
Sharon to Sarah Althea Hill, who immediately
became Sharon’s mistress. Growing tired of her
rather quickly, he tried to disentangle himself
from the liaison, with the result that Sarah
Althea filed suit against him in which she pro
duced a marriage certificate to back up her
claims. She lost her case. It was common gos
sip that Mammy Pleasant had spent SIOO,OOO of
Thomas Bell’s money in backing her protegee.
After the trial Sarah Althea was courted by
her attorney, the former Judge Terry They
married. A feud arising during the trial between
Terry and Justice Fields culminated in the death
of Terry, who was shot down by one of Fields’
henchmen. Sarah Althea Hill lost her mind, and
it was Mammy who stepped in, to instigate pro
ceedings whereby the unfortunate Althea was
placed in an asylum.
In the meantime, Thomas Bell was growing
old, and weak, and feeble, with frequent faint
ing spells and attacks of vertigo. Mammy re
mained with the family, deftly managing the
large household, doing the marketing each
morning and engineering quarrels among the
nearly-grown children.
At a late hour one night in October 1892,
Thomas Bel) was found sprawled out in the
courtyard unconscious. He had apparently fallen
from the balcony three flights above He died
without regaining consciousness. A red shawl
belonging to Mammy was found in extremely
close proximity to where he met his death, and
when the servants went to Mammy’s quarters
to arouse her. she immediately appeared at the
door erttirely clothed despite the fact that the
rest of the household had been in bed for hours.
Police suspected that Bell had not accidentally
fallen from the balcony, but the case was al
lowed to drop.
It is coincidental that four years later,
Thomas Frederick Bell met with an accident
which was almost the exact duplicate of that
causing the death of his father. He fell over
the bannister of the circular stairway from a
high point down into the courtyard below. For
several days he lay unconscious and was bed-

1661 Octavia Street, San Francisco.
ridden for a period of eight or ten weeks. Was
Mammy’s sinister influence behind either of
these “accidents”? No matter what question
was put to Mammy when she took the stand
in frequent court sessions, she was always
shrewdly able to clear her own name and es
cape any penalty of the law.
IN THE sensational court hearing in 1897, at
the time Thomas Frederick, known as Fred
Bell, sought to have Teresa Clingan Bell re
moved’ as guardian of his minor brothers and
sisters, alleging incompetency, the trial brought
out the startling statement that neither he nor
his sister, Marie Teresa, were Mrs. Bell’s chil
dren. However, their father had named them
specifically in his will as his own, and whether
or not they were actually his blood children
or adopted was not determined. Mammy up
held Mrs. Bell in her statement that only* four
children had been born to her. She appeared in
court and took her oath on it.
At the hearing Fred Bell brought a jeweler
into court who testified that Mammy had left
diamonds valued at SIOO,OOO, the property of
Mrs. Bell, with him for safekeeping. The wit
ness stated that Mammy came for the jewels
soon after Thomas Bell’s death. Another wit
ness testified that he had kept laces valued at
more than SSOOO for the Bells. Both said their
dealings had been direct with Mammy. But
Mammy made satisfactory explanations to the
court as to the disposal of these valuables, and
the hearing came to naught.
Fred Bell managed to get himself into one
scrape after another. There was one in par
ticular with Alphonso Barillas, son of Guate
mala’s president, in a questionable house on
Bush Street, in which he was seriously injured,
but no specific charges were brought, and the
shroud of mystery that screened all occurrences
in which Mammy had a hand settled over the
incident.
Some years later, following the deaths of both
Mrs. Bell and Mammy, the Bell estate was un
der litigation for many years. It was only in
comparatively recent years, after investigations
that reached from San Francisco to Peru, to
China, and back again had been made, that the
court divided the estate. But the Bell family
was a strange menage, and Fred Bell strangest
of all. In less than two years after receiving
a substantial settlement, Fred was seen penni
less on a San Francisco street corner selling
apples. He died shortly after in a home for the
poor.
During the years Mammy Pleasant lived with
the Bells in the “House of Mystery” on Octavia
Street, many strange things went on behind
closed doors. Lights burned at all hours. Shad
owy figures came and went. From whence they
came, and where they went, their identity, no
one but Mammy knew, and Mammy never
talked. Following Mammy’s death, the old man
sion became virtually a ""haunted house.” Pass
ersby claimed they often saw a strange light
through the cracks of the boarded doors and
windows late at night, and Mammy’s ghost was
believed to haunt the house. The house was
finally torn down.
Mammy, before her death, quarreled vio
lently with Mrs. Bell and left her to go to
friends in Oakland who looked after Mammy
until she died at the age of 92. She was prac
tically penniless when she died. There were no
relatives—no heirs. She provided for a tomb
stone and her dying wish was that on it be
carved, “She Was A Friend of John Brown.""
There were many who breathed easier with
Mammy’s passing.
Mary Ellen Pleasant was a character unique.
She was the friend of all those whom she felt
worthy of her good graces. At the same time,
she could have made life extremely uneasy for
dozens of the State’s most prominent figures
whose lives she knew intimately. But her policy
was always silence. She was paid, and hand
somely, for what she knew, but it was the
power and not the money that intrigued her.
It is remarkable and amazing that a woman
with a heritage so meager could rise to such
great heights of power and influence—even
though in so many respects it was evil and
sinister.
A black woman who determined the destiny
of white men was Mammy Pleasant. She was
born to rule, and rule she did, not unlike a
queen from her ""palace"" on Octavia fetreet—
the ""House of Mystery.”

between 4.000 and 6.000 Spanish
Loyalist troops is struggling thru
the rugged, snow capped peaks of
the Pyrenees seeking safety in
France, it was disclosed today.
French mobile guards, patrolling
the mfountain passes, kept binocu
lars trained in an effort to find and
aid the Loyalists. They reported
an occasional glimpse of men strug
gling up the passes but there has
been no news in recent days of
the main body.
The Loyalists belonged to the 43d
division of the 10th army corps,
shattered on the northern flank of
the Catalonian battle line days
ago. They were with the 31st divi
sion. whose men got safely to
France and were returned to Cata

The 43d division men. retreating
to Bielsa and then to Fanlo. stop
ped and stood by while the civilian
population fled. Then they turned
northward themselves to the Py -

Meantime the Nationalists had
closed in and, according to reports,
the Loyalists found the mountain
passes directly ahead of them al
most impossible to cross.

Death Ends Forty Year
Watch of Ancient Indian
Coat Herder in Arizona
OCTAVE. Ariz., April 7. <UP)
This is one of Arizona's many rug
ged, isolated mountain region:
where some people, weary of civili
zation, have fled to live out their
lives in the solitude of nature.
They pay little attention to each
other. They live by prospecting,
by small incomes or by ranching.
Their histories are mysterious.
But today, all felt strangely alone.
A familiar, bent old Indian goat
herder was dead. Josefa Alvarez,
who. some said, was “115 or 120
years old,” and whose life was I
one of many colorful legends, lav j
buried beside her many friends
in Boot Hill cemetery on Weaver
Creek.
Josefa, whom all knew as ""the
goat herder,” had led her flock j
through the mountains here for 1
40 years. No one knew her well.
She kept away from intruders.
Her familiar figure, smoking rolled
brown paper cigarettes, had been
seen daily, year after year.
Her life, as far as was known
here, was mainly legendary. It was
said she once was the queen of an
Indian village near San Diego when
